/**
 * Defines methods that all servlets must implement.
 *
 * <p>
 * A servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server. Servlets
 * receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP, the
 * HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 *
 * <p>
 * To implement this interface, you can write a generic servlet that extends
 * <code>javax.servlet.GenericServlet</code> or an HTTP servlet that extends
 * <code>javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface defines methods to initialize a servlet, to service requests,
 * and to remove a servlet from the server. These are known as life-cycle
 * methods and are called in the following sequence:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The servlet is constructed, then initialized with the <code>init</code>
 * method.
 * <li>Any calls from clients to the <code>service</code> method are handled.
 * <li>The servlet is taken out of service, then destroyed with the
 * <code>destroy</code> method, then garbage collected and finalized.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to the life-cycle methods, this interface provides the
 * <code>getServletConfig</code> method, which the servlet can use to get any
 * startup information, and the <code>getServletInfo</code> method, which allows
 * the servlet to return basic information about itself, such as author,
 * version, and copyright（版权）.
 *
 * @see GenericServlet
 * @see javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet

/**
 * 由于Servlet不是线程安全的，一个应用程序中所有的用户公用一个Servlet实例，因此不建议使用类
 * 级别的变量（只使用局部变量最好），除非是只读的或者java.utilconcurrent.atomic包中的成员。
